# Bill Gates Spending Money

This project is a React-based simulation that allows users to imagine how Bill Gates might spend his fortune. The application provides a list of items and allows the user to "purchase" them by subtracting the cost from Bill Gates' total wealth. The goal is to see how many items one can "buy" before running out of money.
