# Drumkit Project

## Overview

This project is a simple drumkit application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Each button is associated with a different drum sound, and an animation is triggered when a sound is played.

## Features

- **Drum Sounds**: The application includes various drum sounds such as Boom, Hihat, Openhat, Ride, Snare, Tink, and Tom.

  - `D` for Openhat
  - `F` for Ride
  - `G` for Snare
  - `H` for Tink
  - `J` for Tom
- **Visual Feedback**: Each button provides visual feedback when pressed or when the corresponding key is pressed.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the drumkit.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the drumkit and animation effects.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles audio playback and button/keyboard interactions.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Play Sounds**: Click the buttons to play different drum sounds or press the corresponding keys:
   - `A` - Boom
   - `S` - Hihat
   - `D` - Openhat
   - `F` - Ride
   - `G` - Snare
   - `H` - Tink
   - `J` - Tom
3. **Visual Feedback**: Observe the animation effect on the buttons when they are clicked or when the keys are pressed.

## Development

- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript functions handle audio playback and trigger animations for button presses and key presses.
- **CSS**: The CSS file includes styles for the drumkit layout and animation effects.
- **HTML**: The HTML file provides the structure for the drumkit, including buttons and audio elements.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Sound**: Ensure that the sound files (e.g., `boom.wav`, `hihat.wav`, etc.) are correctly placed in the `./sounds/` directory.
- **Animation Issues**: Check the CSS for the `.active` class to ensure that the animation is defined correctly.
